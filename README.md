# Final Project Assignment 2: Explore One More! (FP2) 
DUE March 30, 2015 Monday (2015-03-30)

This is just like FP1, but where you do a different library. (Full description of FP1 is [on Piazza.][piazza])

During this assignment, you should start looking for teammates. See the project schedule [on Piazza.][schedule]

Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below. You can delete them if you like, or just leave them at the bottom.
You are allowed to change/delete anything in this file to make it into your report. It will be public.

This file is formatted with the [**markdown** language][markdown], so take a glance at how that works.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

Code is super easy in markdown, which you can easily do inline `(require net/url)` or do in whole blocks:
```
#lang racket

(require games/cards)

(define numbers (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))

(shuffle-list numbers 7)
```

### My Library: Cards: Virtual Playing Cards Library
Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:
 
I used the virtual playing cards library. The program is short but sweet, it defines a list of 4 numbers, then it shuffles the four numbers before it outputs the new list of shuffled numbers. The shuffle procedure splits the list in half then taking the first number of one of the randomly selected side and adds to the shuffled list. The list does this 7 times.
